# Fuseki

Apache [Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/index.html) with SeCo extensions.

Available also in Docker Hub: [secoresearch/fuseki](https://hub.docker.com/r/secoresearch/fuseki/).

The Fuseki administrative interface is accessible at `http://localhost:3030` with the admin password defined as `docker run` parameter (see `Run` below).

The container has a preconfigured service/dataset `ds` that has a Lucene [text index](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html) and [spatial index](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/spatial-query.html) (see [assembler.ttl](https://github.com/SemanticComputing/fuseki-docker/blob/master/assembler.ttl) for configuration).

The data can be accessed via the endpoints:
* [SPARQL 1.1 query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/): `http://localhost:3030/ds/sparql`
* [Graph Store HTTP Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/) (read-only): `http://localhost:3030/ds/data`

The container includes Jena tdbloader, textindexer, spatialindexer, and tdbstats scripts for loading RDF data into TDB model. See the [Dockerfile of the congress-legislators dataset](https://github.com/SemanticComputing/congress-legislators/blob/master/Dockerfile) for an example.

**Note on running in OpenShift**, if you use this image as a parent image (e.g. use your own Dockerfile to load the data inside the image using TDBLOADER): as containers are ran as an arbitrary user, you'll have to ensure the write permission on the TDB and index directories, e.g. by adding the following lines in your Dockerfile after the tdbloader and indexing commands:

```
# Set permissions to allow fuseki to run as an arbitrary user
RUN chgrp -R 0 $FUSEKI_BASE \
    && chmod -R g+rwX $FUSEKI_BASE
```

## Build

`docker build --squash -t secoresearch/fuseki .`

## Run

`docker run --rm -it -p 3030:3030 --name fuseki -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=[PASSWORD] secoresearch/fuseki`

The same command can be used to pull and run the container from Docker Hub (no need to build the image first).
